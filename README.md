# CoffeeBashX
It will give you a potion called Coffee, and when you drink it you will get extreme nausea for 30 seconds, along with strength and speed. I plan to make a delay for each coffee purchase, and take money from players when they buy it. They can also craft it using Cocoa, a bottle, and Sugar! This plugin is used for PVP purposes and can go great with factions. It really is neat and I really think you'll all enjoy it when it becomes released. Hopefully, this plugin will be 100% done by the the middle of December or maybe even earlier!
